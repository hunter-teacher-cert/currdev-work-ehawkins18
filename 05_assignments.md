# 2 Assignments for the Unit Plan

## 1. Number Guesser
### Description
This is the first formative assessment for the unit. Students will complete this project after a series of lessons teaching them:
* print statements
* variables
* text input
* string concatenation
* arithmetic operators
* simple conditional statements
* random number generation

## Directions
For this project, you will use Python to create a number guessing game. The computer will pick a random number from 1 – 10 and the player will be asked to guess the number. The player will continue guessing until the secret number is guessed correctly.

The first draft of your game (Basic Level) should include the following:
* The computer picks a secret number from 1 – 10 (automatic/random)
* The computer asks the player to guess the number
* The computer checks the guess to see if it is right
* If the guess is correct, the computer congratulates the player and the game ends
* If the guess is wrong, the computer asks the player to guess again

After you get the Basic Level working properly, add the following to make the Intermediate Level:
* A score counter that tracks the number of guesses and reports the player’s final score (number of guesses)

After you get the Intermediate level working properly, add the following to make the Advanced Level:
* For incorrect guesses, the computer should tell the player if the guess is too high or too low
* Allow the player to specify the range of numbers to guess from (not just 1 – 10)



## 2. Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Description
This is the second formative assessment for the unit. Students will complete this project after a series of lessons teaching them:
* Functions - Definition, parameters, arguments
* Functions with 2 parameters
* Compound conditional statements

## Directions:
For this project, you will use Python to make a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The player will play against the computer. The computer will ask the user to choose “Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors” for themself. The computer will then choose “Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors” automatically for itself and will display the result of the game.

The first draft of your game (Basic Level) should include the following:
* The computer asks the player to enter 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors
* The computer randomly picks 1, 2, or 3 for itself
* The computer displays the player's choice and the computer's choice
* The computer determines the winner (player, computer, or draw/tie)

After you get the Basic Level working properly, add the following to make the Intermediate Level:
* Score counters to keep track of player wins and computer wins
* Play best of 3 to win
* Report the result of each round and then the winner of the match

After you get the Intermediate level working properly, add the following to make the Advanced Level:
* Ask the user how many rounds are needed to win the match (i.e. 3 wins / best of 5, 4 wins / best of 7, etc.)
