## Week 04: Languages

#### What is the course?
The course is AP Computer Science Principles.

#### What is the language?
The language that was discussed in class this week that I feel would be a good fit for this course is Scratch.

#### How does one write and run code in this language?
One writes and runs code in Scratch using the self-contained IDE on the Scratch website.

#### Rate the complexity of the syntax.
Scratch is a block-based programming language. The syntax is very simple.

#### Strengths
The main strengths of Scratch are its accessability and approachability. Scratch can be accessed from any machine with an internet connection. No special software is required. Everything is contained on the Scratch website. The language is approachable for people with no coding experience. It is a popular first language. However, it is capable of complexity that makes it usable by experienced programmers as well. There are a wealth of tutorials and support materials (videos, existing projects, etc.) freely available.

#### How would you utilize the strengths in your class?
Scratch provides multiple points of entry for students with varying levels of prior coding experience, so all students in the class can get to coding on day 1. The wealth of open-source support materials allows for scaffolding students who need extra support. The capabilities of the language to create complex coding projects allows for differentiation and extension activities.

#### Weaknesses
Scratch is entirely block-based with no option for text-based coding. Some students have used Scratch in earlier classes, some as early as elementary school. Some students percieve Scratch as "not real" coding.

#### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
I have seen some very advanced complex projects created using Scratch. I would mitigate the "this is for little kids" perception by assigning a difficult project early in the course that challenges the students' abilities. I would mitigate the fact that Scratch is block-based by introducing text-based coding in a Python unit at the end of the year (after the AP test).

#### Why did you select this language for this class?
Up to now, I have taught AP CSP using the Snap! programming language. Though Snap! and Scratch are quite similar, there are many more support materials readily available for Scratch. I plan to try using Scratch next time I teach AP CSP. The AP CSP course is meant to provide access to Computer Science education for those who are traditionally under-represented in CS. I think that Scratch is a good fit to allow access to those who are new to CS while also providing opportunities to challenge students who already have some programming experience.
