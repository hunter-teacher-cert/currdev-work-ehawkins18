## 9-12.CT.5: 
Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

## 9-12.CT.6: 
Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

An activity that addresses these two standards is to have students code the binary search algorithm both iteratively and recursively.
