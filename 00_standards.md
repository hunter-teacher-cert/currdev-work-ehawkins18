## 9-12.CT.5: 
Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

## 9-12.CT.6: 
Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

## Activity:
An activity that addresses these two standards is to have students code the linear search algorithm and then the binary search algorith. Students could then do a run time comparison (as we did in our summer class) and discuss the trade-offs between the two algorithms. The students would then submit a journal entry describing how the two algorithms work and analyzing the trade-offs for ease of coding vs. run-time performance. An extension activity for advanced students would be to code the binary search algorithm recursively to compare with the iterative binary search algorithm.
