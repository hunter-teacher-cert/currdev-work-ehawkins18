## Week 06: 2 technological tools I currently use in my classroom
### Tool#1 - Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy

* The name of the tool: Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy
* What its general purpose is: CMU CS Academy is an online, graphics-based computer science curriculum taught in Python provided by Carnegie Mellon University. 
* The class(es) you use it in: Python Programming (11th grade)
* How you use it in class: I use CMU CS Academy as the main coding platform for the first semester of my year-long 11th grade Python Programming class. Students complete lessons and exercises in CMU and I can monitor progress, grade work, and give feedback.
* Why you have selected that tool for that purpose? I selected CMU CS Academy because it is self-contained, allows students to work remotely, is self-paced, and allows me to monitor progress and offer feedback. There have been many times that students have been out of school for legitimate reasons for extended periods and this has allowed them to keep up with classwork and assignments while working remotely.

### Tool#2 - Padlet
* The name of the tool: Padlet
* What its general purpose is: I would describe Padlet as an "online bulletin board". Students can post material and (with permission from the instructor) comment on other students' posts. 
* The class(es) you use it in: Python Programming (11th grade)
* How you use it in class: I use Padlet to collect work, to aid in the facilitation of class discussions, for 'gallery walks', and to allow students to offer and receive feedback on their work.
* Why you have selected that tool for that purpose? I selected Padlet because the premium version was made available for free during remote schooling and it really helped for all of the purposes mentioned above.
