## Compare: Code.org vs. BJC for AP CSP 

I have previously taught AP CSP using the BJC curriculum and this year I am teaching AP CSP using the Code.org curriculum for the first time. 

#### Major Differences

The BJC curriculum utilizes the Snap! programming language for the coding portion of the class. The curriculum does not integrate the non-coding units with the coding units/IDE in one platform. The Code.org curriculum, on the other hand, is self-contained. Everything is integrated into a single platform including the IDE. The coding portion of the BJC curriculum is strictly block-based. The coding portion of the Code.org curriculum allows students to switch at will between block-based and text-based code.

#### Major Similarities

Both of these curricula match up well with the College Board requirements for the AP CSP course/exam. They both include units/lessons to address all of the Big Ideas of the Course Framework, and both include a mix of coding and "unplugged" lessons/activities. 

#### Comparitive Strengths & Weaknesses

Major strengths of the Code.org course include the students' ability to switch between block-based and text-based coding, the integration of an "all-in-one" platform including an IDE for the coding activities, progress monitoring/reporting for teachers to track student progress, and inclusion of a full-length practice exam.

#### Inclusion of Elements of the Other Curriculum

As this is the first year that I am using the Code.org curriculum, it is unlikely that I will adopt anything from outside of the self-contained curriculum into the course this year. However, in the future I might draw from the BJC curriculum to include some of the labs/projects as extension activities and/or extra coding practice for the students.
